Project Description
This project, Attendance Management System using Face Recognition, uses facial recognition technology to make attendance tracking easier. It captures and stores facial data, then compares it with the data in the database to mark attendance automatically. This system helps reduce the need for manual work, making it more efficient for schools or companies.

Key Features:
🏫 Real-time facial recognition to take attendance.
💾 Secure database storage for attendance data.
🔒 Error handling to make sure everything works smoothly.
